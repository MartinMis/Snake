# Simple snake clone in C++ with SFML
A simple copy of classic game ***Snake*** created in C++ with the SFML library. I am sure the code isn't the most optimal, but seeing as this project was created as a my first ever project with SFML I am satisfied with minimal viable product. Originaly the code was written on Linux but it should be also possible to run it on Windows by changing the build script to provide all the needed SFML files.


## Future improvements
- [ ] Clean up the code
- [ ] Make sure you, the fruit wont spawn **into** the snake
- [ ] Fix the bug where if you press certain movement keys in quick succession you can crash into yourself without visibly moving
- [ ] Add an option for replay
- [ ] Create more permanent make file
